coursera/getting and cleaning data/ assignment/ making a tidy data set

This repo is created to complete the assignment for the Coursera course “getting and cleaning data”.


This repo contains three files:-
1) Codebook:-

It contains the descriptions of variables used and functions performed on those variables.

2) R_analysis.R:-

This file performs various functions as:-
Download the zipped file into an already set directory and unzips it. The code runs as asked in the step of the assignment. It filters the required activity columns from the dataset. Provides the column with names/column headers. Then merges the data from train and test models into one dataset. Lastly, perform the mean function on the asked columns and make a new tidy data set with the above data.

3) Tidydata.txt:-

This file contains the tidy data which is formed after performing the R_analysis.R code on the dataset in zip files.



NOTE :- It is recommended to go through the link(“http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones”) and read the information carefully as it is very important to understand the data and its structure to complete the assignment. Once you get the hold of the data , the required steps are easily comprehensible.
